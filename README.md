# Platformer
NES-styled game about a mongoose with superpowers

Currently it's basically a homemade game engine with attempts of making prototype levels

I always wanted to make a game with visuals, gameplay and music similar to the games I liked to play in my childhood

This is my precious sandbox

# Tools and dependencies

Project is built with Visual Studio 2015
It uses external libraries: SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf, vld, tinyxml, INIReader, dirent.h

# Contributing

If anyone would like to work on this with me or even just give ideas and feedback, I'll be happy to have you onboard or hear you out :)

# Using code/assets in your own projects

You can freely do whatever you want with the code provided you mention my name in the credits.
But I do not want you to use texture/sprite data for commercial purposes though
(yeah some of those are brought from other games as templates but this will be fixed at some point)
